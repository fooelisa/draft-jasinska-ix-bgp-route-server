Abstract

    implementations.


1. Survey Summary

    This document provides a survey of Internet Exchange Route Server [1]

    The editor makes no claim as to the accuracy of the information
    provided.

    The following organizations reported having implementations of
    Internet Exchange Route Server: Cisco Systems, BIRD and Quagga.

    All Route Server implementations adhere to the specifications 
    described in [1]. All implementations provide the means for per-peer
    policy control.

    Multiple test studies have been published on resource consumption
    of Route Server implementations of the various vendors, e.g.:
