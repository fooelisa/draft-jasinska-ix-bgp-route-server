      <t>
        The growing popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings a new
        set of requirements to interconnect participating networks. While
        bilateral exterior BGP sessions between exchange participants were
        previously the most common means of exchanging reachability
        information, the overhead associated with dense interconnection has
        caused substantial operational scaling problems for Internet exchange
        point participants.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document outlines a specification for multilateral
        interconnections at IXPs. Multilateral interconnection is a
        method of exchanging routing information between three or more BGP
        speakers using a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a
        route server. Route servers are typically used on shared access media
        networks such as Internet exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified
        interconnection between multiple Internet routers on such a network.

     <section title="Introduction to Multilateral Interconnection">
      <t>
        Internet exchange points (IXPs) provide IP data interconnection
        facilities for their participants, typically using shared Layer-2
        networking media such as Ethernet. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
        <xref target="RFC4271" />, an inter-Autonomous System routing
        protocol, is commonly used to facilitate exchange of network
        reachability information over such media.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the case of bilateral interconnection between two exchange
        participant routers, each router must be configured with a BGP session
        to the other. At IXPs with many participants who wish to implement
        dense interconnection, this requirement can lead both to large router
        configurations and high administrative overhead. Given the growth in
        the number of participants at many IXPs, it has become operationally
        troublesome to implement densely meshed interconnections at these
        IXPs.
      </t>
      <t>
        Multilateral interconnection is a method of interconnecting BGP
        speaking routers using a third party brokering system, commonly
        referred to as a route server and typically managed by the IXP
        operator. Each of the multilateral interconnection participants
        (usually referred to as route server clients) announces network
        reachability information to the route server using exterior BGP, and
        the route server in turn forwards this information to each other route
        server client connected to it, according to its configuration.
        Although a route server uses BGP to exchange reachability information 
        with each of its clients, it does not forward traffic itself and is 
        therefore not a router.
      </t>
      <t>
        A route server can be viewed as similar in function to an <xref
        target="RFC4456" /> route reflector, except that it operates using
        EBGP instead of iBGP. Certain adaptions to <xref target="RFC4271" /> are 
        required, to enable an EBGP router to operate as a route server, which 
        are outlined in <xref target="spec" /> of this document. 
        Operational considerations to be taken into account in a route server
        deployment are subject of <xref target="ops_considerations" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        The term "route server" is often in a different context used to
        describe a BGP node whose purpose is to accept BGP feeds from
        multiple clients for the purpose of operational analysis and
        troubleshooting.  A system of this form may alternatively be known
        as a "route collector" or a "route-views server".  This document
        uses the term "route server" exclusively to describe multilateral
        peering brokerage systems.

    <section title="Bilateral Interconnection">
      <t>
        Bilateral interconnection is a method of interconnecting
        routers using individual BGP sessions between each participant router
        on an IXP in order to exchange reachability information. While
        interconnection policies vary from participant to participant, most
        IXPs have significant numbers of participants who see value in
        interconnecting with as many other exchange participants as possible.
        In order for an IXP participant to implement a dense interconnection
        policy, it is necessary for the participant to liaise with each of
        their intended interconnection partners and if this partner agrees to
        interconnect, then both participants' routers must be configured with
        a BGP session to exchange network reachability information. If each
        exchange participant interconnects with each other participant, a full
        mesh of BGP sessions is needed, as detailed in <xref
        target="ixp_interconnection" />.

        <xref target="ixp_interconnection" /> depicts an IXP platform with
        four connected routers, administered by four separate exchange
        participants, each of them with a locally unique autonomous system number:
        AS1, AS2, AS3 and AS4. Each of these four participants wishes to
        exchange traffic with all other participants; this is accomplished by
        configuring a full mesh of BGP sessions on each router connected to
        the exchange, resulting in 6 BGP sessions across the IXP fabric.
      </t>
      <t>
        The number of BGP sessions at an exchange has an upper bound of
        n*(n-1)/2, where n is the number of routers at the exchange. As many
        exchanges have relatively large numbers of participating networks, the
        quadratic scaling requirements of dense interconnection tend to cause
        operational and administrative overhead at large IXPs. Consequently,
        new participants to an IXP require significant initial resourcing in
        order to gain value from their IXP connection, while existing exchange
        participants need to commit ongoing resources in order to benefit from
        interconnecting with these new participants.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Multilateral Interconnection">
      <t>
        Multilateral interconnection is implemented using a route server
        configured to use BGP to distribute network layer reachability
        information (NLRI) among all client routers. The route server
        preserves the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute from all received NLRI UPDATE
        messages, and passes these messages with unchanged NEXT_HOP to its
        route server clients, according to its configured routing policy.
        Using this method of exchanging NLRI messages, an IXP participant
        router can receive an aggregated list of prefixes from all other route
        server clients using a single BGP session to the route server instead
        of depending on BGP sessions with each other router at the exchange.
        This reduces the overall number of BGP sessions at an Internet
        exchange from n*(n-1)/2 to n, where n is the number of routers at the
        exchange.
      </t>
      <t>
        In practical terms, this allows dense interconnection between IXP
        participants with low administrative overhead and significantly
        simpler and smaller router configurations. In particular, new IXP
        participants benefit from immediate and extensive interconnection,
        while existing route server participants receive reachability
        information from these new participants without necessarily having to
        adapt their configurations.

        As illustrated in <xref target="rs_interconnection" />, each router on
        the IXP fabric requires only a single BGP session to the route server,
        from which it can receive reachability information for all other
        routers on the IXP which also connect to the route server.

    <section title="Technical Considerations for Route Server Implementations" anchor="spec">

      <section title="Client UPDATE Messages">
        <t>
          A route server MUST accept all UPDATE messages received
          from each of its clients for inclusion in its Adj-RIB-In. These
          UPDATE messages MAY by omitted from the route
          server's Loc-RIB or Loc-RIBs, due to filters configured for the
          purposes of implementing routing policy. The route server SHOULD
          perform one or more BGP Decision Processes to select routes for
          subsequent advertisement to its clients, taking into account
          possible configuration to provide multiple NLRI paths to a
          particular client as described in <xref target="phm_multiple_paths"
          /> or multiple Loc-RIBs as described in <xref
          target="phm_multiple_ribs" />. The route server SHOULD forward
          UPDATE messages where appropriate from its Loc-RIB or Loc-RIBs to
          its clients.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Attribute Transparency">
        <t>
          As a route server primarily performs a brokering service,
          modification of attributes could cause route server clients to alter
          their BGP best-path selection process for received prefix
          reachability information, thereby changing the intended routing
          policies of exchange participants. Therefore, contrary to what is
          specified in section 5. of <xref target="RFC4271" />, route servers
          SHOULD NOT update well-known BGP attributes received from route
          server clients before redistributing them to their other route server
          clients. Optional recognized and unrecognized BGP attributes, 
          whether transitive or non-transitive, SHOULD NOT be updated by 
          the route server and SHOULD be passed on to other route server 
          clients.
        </t>

        <section title="NEXT_HOP Attribute">
          <t>
            The NEXT_HOP, a well-known mandatory BGP attribute, 
            defines the IP address of the router
            used as the next hop to the destinations listed in the Network
            Layer Reachability Information field of the UPDATE message. As the
            route server does not participate in the actual routing of
            traffic, the NEXT_HOP attribute MUST be passed unmodified to the
            route server clients, similar to the "third party" next hop
            feature described in section 5.1.3. of <xref target="RFC4271" />.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="AS_PATH Attribute" anchor="as_path_attr">
          <t>
            AS_PATH is a well-known mandatory attribute which identifies the
            autonomous systems through which routing information carried in
            the UPDATE message has passed.
          </t>
          <t>
            As a route server does not participate in the process of
            forwarding data between client routers, and because modification
            of the AS_PATH attribute could affect route server client
            best-path calculations, the route server SHOULD NOT prepend
            its own AS number to the AS_PATH segment nor modify the AS_PATH
            segment in any other way.

            MULTI_EXIT_DISC is an optional non-transitive attribute intended
            to be used on external (inter-AS) links to discriminate among
            multiple exit or entry points to the same neighboring AS. If
            applied to an NLRI UPDATE sent to a route server, the attribute
            (contrary to section 5.1.4 of <xref target="RFC4271" />) SHOULD
            be propagated to other route server clients and the route server

            While IXP participants often use route servers with the intention
            of interconnecting with as many other route server participants as
            possible, there are several circumstances where control of prefix

            Using the example in <xref target="ixp_filtered_interconnection"
            />, AS1 does not directly exchange prefix information with either
            AS2 or AS3 at the IXP, but only interconnects with AS4.
          </t>
          <t> 
            In the traditional bilateral interconnection model, prefix
            filtering to a third party exchange participant is accomplished
            either by not engaging in a bilateral interconnection with that
            participant or else by implementing outbound prefix filtering on
            the BGP session towards that participant. However, in a
            multilateral interconnection environment, only the route server
            can perform outbound prefix filtering in the direction of the
            route server client; route server clients depend on the
            route server to perform their filtering for them.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the same prefix is sent to a route server from multiple route
            server clients with different BGP attributes, and traditional
            best-path route selection is performed on that list of prefixes,
            then the route server will select a single best-path prefix for
            propagation to all connected clients. If, however, the route
            server has been configured to filter the calculated best-path
            prefix from reaching a particular route server client, then that
            client will receive no reachability information for that prefix
            from the route server, despite the fact that the route server has
            received alternative reachability information for that prefix from
            other route server clients. This phenomenon is referred to as
            "prefix hiding".
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, in <xref target="ixp_filtered_interconnection" />, if
            the same prefix were sent to the route server via AS2 and AS4, and
            the route via AS2 was preferred according to BGP's traditional
            best-path selection, but AS2 was filtered by AS1, then AS1 would
            never receive this prefix, even though the route server had
            previously received a valid alternative path via AS4. This happens
            because the best-path selection is performed only once on the
            route server for all clients.
          </t>
          <t>
            It should be noted that prefix hiding will only occur on route servers
            which employ per-client prefix filtering; if an IXP operator
            deploys a route server without prefix filtering, then prefix
            hiding does not occur, as all paths are considered equally valid
            from the point of view of the route server.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are several techniques which may be employed to prevent the
            prefix hiding problem from occurring. Route server implementations
            SHOULD implement at least one method to prevent prefix hiding.

            <t>
              The most portable means of preventing the route server prefix
              hiding problem is by using a route server BGP implementation
              which performs the per-client best-path calculation for each set
              of prefixes which results after the route server's client
              filtering policies have been taken into consideration. This can
              be implemented by using per-client Loc-RIBs, with prefix
              filtering implemented between the Adj-RIB-In and the per-client
              Loc-RIB. Implementations MAY optimize this by
              maintaining prefixes not subject to filtering policies in a
              global Loc-RIB, with per-client Loc-RIBs stored as deltas.
            </t>
            <t>
              This problem mitigation technique is highly portable, as it
              makes no assumptions about the feature capabilities of the route
              server clients.

          <section title="Advertising Multiple Paths" anchor="phm_multiple_paths"> 
            <t>
              The prefix distribution model described above assumes standard
              BGP session encoding where the route server sends a single path
              to its client for any given prefix. This path is selected using
              the BGP path selection decision process described in <xref
              target="RFC4271" />. If, however, it were possible for the route
              server to send more than a single path to a route server client,
              then route server
              clients would no longer depend on receiving a single best path to a
              particular prefix; consequently, the prefix hiding problem
              described in <xref target="prefix_hiding" /> would disappear.
            </t>
            <t>
              We present two methods which describe how such
              increased path diversity could be implemented.

            <section title="Diverse BGP Path Approach" anchor="phm_diverse_bgp"> 
              <t>
                The Diverse BGP Path proposal as defined in <xref
                target="I-D.ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist"></xref> is a
                simple way to distribute multiple prefix paths from a route
                server to a route server client by using a separate BGP
                session from the route server to a client
                for each different path.
              </t>
              <t>
                The number of paths which may be distributed to a client is
                constrained by the number of BGP sessions which the server and
                the client are willing to establish with each other. The
                distributed paths may be established from the global BGP
                Loc-RIB on the route server in addition to any per-client
                Loc-RIB. As there may be more potential paths to a given
                prefix than configured BGP sessions, this method is not
                guaranteed to eliminate the prefix hiding problem in all
                situations. Furthermore, this method may significantly
                increase the number of BGP sessions handled by the route
                server, which may negatively impact its performance.

                The <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths"></xref> Internet
                draft proposes a different approach to multiple path
                propagation, by allowing a BGP speaker to forward multiple
                paths for the same prefix on a single BGP session. As <xref
                target="RFC4271" /> specifies that a BGP listener must
                implement an implicit withdraw when it receives an UPDATE
                message for a prefix which already exists in its Adj-RIB-In,
                this approach requires explicit support for the feature both
                on the route server and on its clients. 
              </t>
         	    <t>
                If the ADD-PATH capability is negotiated bidirectionally
                between the route server and a route server client, and the
                route server client propagates multiple paths for the same
                prefix to the route server, then this could potentially cause
                the propagation of inactive, invalid or suboptimal paths to
                the route server, thereby causing loss of reachability to
                other route server clients. For this reason, ADD-PATH
                implementations on a route server SHOULD enforce send-only
                mode with the route server clients, which would result in 
                negotiating receive-only mode from the client to the route 
                server.

      <section title="Route Server Scaling" anchor="ops_scaling"> 
        <t>
          While deployment of multiple Loc-RIBs on the route server presents a
          simple way to avoid the prefix hiding problem noted in <xref
          target="prefix_hiding" />, this approach requires significantly more
          computing resources on the route server than where a single Loc-RIB
          is deployed for all clients. As the <xref target="RFC4271" />
          Decision Process must be applied to all Loc-RIBs deployed on the
          route server, both CPU and memory requirements on the host computer
          scale approximately according to O(P * N), where P is the total
          number of unique prefixes received by the route server and N is the
          number of route server clients which require a unique Loc-RIB. As
          this is a super-linear scaling relationship, large route servers
          may derive benefit from deploying per-client
          Loc-RIBs only where they are required.
        </t>
        <t>
          Regardless of any Loc-RIB optimization implemented, the route
          server's control plane bandwidth requirements will scale
          according to O(P * N), where P is the total number of
          unique prefixes received by the route server and N is the total
          number of route server clients. In the case where P_avg (the arithmetic mean
          number of unique prefixes received per route server client) remains
          roughly constant even as the number of connected clients increases,
          this relationship can be rewritten as O((P_avg * N) * N) or O(N^2).
          This quadratic upper bound on the network traffic requirements
          indicates that the route server model will not scale to
          arbitrarily large sizes.
        </t>

        <section title="Tackling Scaling Issues">
          <t>
            The network traffic scaling issue presents significant
            difficulties with no clear solution - ultimately, each client
            must receive a UPDATE for each unique prefix received by the
            route server.  However, there are several potential methods for
            dealing with the CPU and memory resource requirements of route
            servers.
          </t>

          <section title="View Merging and Decomposition"> 
            <t>
              View merging and decomposition, outlined in <xref
              target="RS-ARCH" />, describes a method of optimising
              memory and CPU requirements where multiple route server clients
              are subject to exactly the same routing policies.  In this
              situation, the multiple Loc-RIB views required by each client are
              merged into a single view.
            </t>
            <t>
              A variation of this approach may be implemented on
              route servers by ensuring that separate Loc-RIBs are only
              configured for route server clients with unique export peering
              policies.

          <section title="Destination Splitting">
            <t>
              Destination splitting, also described in <xref
              target="RS-ARCH" />, describes a method for route server
              clients to connect to multiple route servers and to send
              non-overlapping sets of prefixes to each route server.  As
              each route server computes the best path for its own set of
              prefixes, the quadratic scaling requirement operates on
              multiple smaller sets of prefixes.  This reduces the overall
              computational and memory requirements for managing multiple
              Loc-RIBs and performing the best-path calculation on each.  In
              order for this method to perform well, destination splitting
              would require significant co-ordination between the route
              server operator and each route server client.  In practice,
              such levels of co-ordination are unlikely to work
              successfully, thereby diminishing the value of this approach.

          <section title="NEXT_HOP Resolution">
            <t>
              As route servers are usually deployed at IXPs which use flat
              layer 2 networks, recursive resolution of the NEXT_HOP
              attribute is generally not required, and can be replaced by a
              simple check to ensure that the NEXT_HOP value for each prefix
              is a network address on the IXP LAN's IP address range.

      <section title="NLRI Leakage Mitigation" anchor="ops_leakage_mitigation"> 
        <t>
          NLRI leakage occurs when a BGP client unintentionally distributes
          NLRI UPDATE messages to one or more neighboring BGP routers. NLRI
          leakage of this form to a route server can cause connectivity
          problems at an IXP if each route server client is configured to
          accept all prefix UPDATE messages from the route server. It is
          therefore RECOMMENDED when deploying route servers that, due to the
          potential for collateral damage caused by NLRI leakage, route server
          operators deploy NLRI leakage mitigation measures in order to
          prevent unintentional prefix announcements or else limit the scale
          of any such leak. Although not foolproof, per-client inbound prefix
          limits can restrict the damage caused by prefix leakage in many
          cases. Per-client inbound prefix filtering on the route server is a
          more deterministic and usually more reliable means of preventing
          prefix leakage, but requires more administrative resources to
          maintain properly.

      <section title="Route Server Redundancy" anchor="ops_use_two_of_em"> 
        <t>
          As the purpose of an IXP route server implementation is to provide a
          reliable reachability brokerage service, it is RECOMMENDED that
          exchange operators who implement route server systems provision
          multiple route servers on each shared Layer-2 domain. There is no
          requirement to use the same BGP implementation or operating system 
          for each route server
          on the IXP fabric; however, it is RECOMMENDED that where an
          operator provisions more than a single server on the same shared
          Layer-2 domain, each route server implementation be configured
          equivalently and in such a manner that the path reachability
          information from each system is identical.

      <section title="AS_PATH Consistency Check"> 
        <t>
          According to <xref target="RFC4271" />, a BGP speaker which
          advertises a route to another external BGP speaker, must prepend
          its own AS number as the last element of the AS_PATH sequence. 
          Therefore, the leftmost autonomous system number in an AS_PATH
          attribute should normally be equal to the autonomous system number
          of the BGP speaker that sent the UPDATE message.
        </t>
        <t>
          Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4271" /> suggests that a BGP
          speaker MAY check the AS_PATH attribute of each UPDATE message to
          ensure that the leftmost AS in the AS_PATH is equal to the
          autonomous system number of the peer which sent the message.
        </t>
        <t>
          Route servers do not modify the AS_PATH attribute (as described in
          <xref target="as_path_attr" />), since they do not participate in
          the traffic exchange.  Therefore a consistency check on the
          AS_PATH of an UPDATE received by a route server client should fail
          if the route server operator does not prepend the route server ASN
          to the AS path.  In this situation, it is RECOMMENDED that route
          server clients disable the AS_PATH consistency check towards the
          route server.

            Prefixes sent to the route server are tagged with certain

            to all other participants, a subset of participants, or none.
            This allows for one-way filtering policies to be implemented
            on the route server; if a participant chooses not to exchange routes
            with a certain other participant, he will have to instruct the route
            server to not announce his own routes and filter incoming routes on
            his own router.
